## Fourier Series
### innter product of two functions
\\[ <f(x), g(x)> = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \bar{g}(x)dx\\]
\\(\bar{g}\\) is the congugate of g on complex number system

### Fourier series definition
let \\(f(x)\\) be a periodic function over a period of \\([-\pi, +\pi]\\)
![f(x)](/images/math/fourier_series/f_x.png)

\\( f(x) \\) can be transformed into below
\\[ f(x) = \frac{A_{0}}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}A_{k}cos(kx) + B_{k}sin(kx)\\],
where
\\[ A_{k} = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{+\pi} f(x)cos(kx)dx = \frac{1}{||cos(kx)||^2}<f(x),cos(kx)> \\]
\\[ B_{k} = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{+\pi} f(x)sin(kx)dx = \frac{1}{||sin(kx)||^2}<f(x),sin(kx)> \\]
where \\(A_{k}, B_{k}\\) is just the **innver product** of \\(f(x)\\), and \\( cos(kx) \\), \\(sin(kx)\\) respectively. intuitively, it is the **projection** of \\(f(x)\\) over \\(sin(kx)\\), or \\(cos(kx)\\). 

### if period is L
\\[ f(x) = \frac{A_{0}}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}A_{k}cos(\frac{2\pi kx}{L}) + B_{k}sin(\frac{2\pi kx}{L})\\],
where 
\\[ A_{k} = \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{L} f(x)cos(\frac{2\pi kx}{L})dx\\]
\\[ B_{k} = \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{L} f(x)sin(\frac{2\pi kx}{L})dx\\]

## Complex Fourier Series
let's define \\[ \psi_k = e^{ikx} = cos(kx) + i \cdot sin(kx)\\]
we can prove that \\(\psi_k, and \psi_j\\) are **orthogonal** as their inner product is zero
**proof**
\\[ <\psi_j, \psi_k> = \int_{-\pi}^{+\pi} e^{jkx}e^{-ikx}dx =  \int_{-\pi}^{+\pi} e^{j(j-k)x}dx = \frac{1}{i(j-k)}[e^{i(j-k)x}]_{-\pi}^{\pi}\\]
it is 0 if \\(j \ne k\\) , \\(2\pi \\) if \\(j=k\\)

**note** conjugate of \\(\psi_k\\) is \\(e^{-ikx}\\)

\\(f(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_k \psi_k\\), where \\(c_k=<f(x), \psi_k> = \int_{-\pi}^{+\pi} f(x)e^{-ikx}dx\\)

## Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
The discrete Fourier transform transforms a sequence of N complex numbers 
\\[\lbrace x_{n} \rbrace := x_0, x_1,..., x_{N-1} \\] into another sequence of complex numbers, 
\\[\lbrace X_{k} \rbrace := X_0, X_1,..., X_{N-1} \\] which is defined by
\\[X_{k} = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_{n} \cdot e^{-\frac{i2\pi}{N}kn}\\]

let the n-th root of unity be \\(\omega_N = e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{N}}\\), we have
\\[ \tag{1.1} X_{k} = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_{n} \cdot \omega_N^{kn}\\]

### inverse DFT
The inverse transform is given by
\\[ \tag{1.2} x_{n} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_{k} \cdot \omega_N^{-kn}\\]


### the unitary DFT
Another way of looking at the DFT is to note that the DFT can be expressed as the DFT matrix, a Vandermonde matrix, introduced by Sylvester in 1867.
\\[
    \boldsymbol{F} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\displaylines{
    \omega_{N}^{0\cdot0}   & \omega_{N}^{0\cdot1}   & \dots  & \omega_{N}^{0\cdot (N-1)}\\\\
    \omega_{N}^{1\cdot0}   & \omega_{N}^{1\cdot1}   & \dots  & \omega_{N}^{2\cdot (N-1)}\\\\
    \vdots                 & \vdots                 & \ddots & \vdots\\\\
    \omega_{N}^{N-1\cdot0} & \omega_{N}^{N-1\cdot1} & \dots  & \omega_{N}^{N-1\cdot (N-1)}
}
\end{bmatrix}
\\]
where \\( \omega_{N} = e^{-\frac{i2\pi}{N}}\\) is a primitive Nth root of unity. (any complex number that yields 1 when raised to some positive integer power n)

\\[ X = F \cdot x^{T}\\]
\\(x\\) is a column vector


## Polynomial & DFT
### Polynomial evaluation & DFT
let a polynomial be
$$f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_nx^n$$
then,
$$f(\omega_N^{k})=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_n\omega_N^{kn},\quadÂ k=0,1,2,...,N-1$$
compare this equation with E.q(1.1), we can know that DFT is the evaluations of a polynomial at N points of Nth root of unity, \\(\omega_N^{0},\omega_N^1,\omega_N^2,...,\omega_N^{N-1}\\)

$$(\omega_N^{0},X_0),(\omega_N^1,X_1),(\omega_N^2,X_2),...,(\omega_N^{N-1},X_{N-1})$$

### Polynomial interpolation & IDFT
According to E.q(1.2), IDFT is the polynomial interpolation (getting original polynomial coefficients).

## Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [3]
The problem is to calculate the below 
\\[ \tag{2.1} X_{k} = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_{n} \cdot \omega_N^{kn}, \quad  k= 0,1,...,N-1\\]
A straightforward calculation using would require \\(N^2\\) operations where "operation" means, as it will throughout this note, a complex multiplication followed by a complex addition.
The FFT algorithm described here iterates on the array and yields the result in less than \\( 2N log_2N \\)

To derive the algorithm, suppose \\(N\\) is a composite, i.e., \\(N = r_1\cdot r_2\\). Then let the indices in (2.1) be expressed
\\[ k = k_1r_1 + k_0, \quad k_0 = 0,1,...,r_1-1, \quad k_1 = 0,1,..., r_2 -1 \\]
\\[ n = n_1r_2 + n_0, \quad n_0 = 0,1,...,r_2-1, \quad n_1 = 0,1,..., r_1 -1 \\]

Since \\(  n = n_1r_2 + n_0\\), we can write

\\[ \tag{2.2} X(k_1, k_0) = \sum_{n_0} \sum_{n_1}x(n_1,n_0)\omega_N^{kn} = \sum_{n_0} \sum_{n_1}x(n_1,n_0)\omega_N^{kn_1r_2}\omega_N^{kn_0}  \\]
**note** \\( x(n_1,n_0)\\) is same to \\(x(n)\\), just the indexing is transformed form 1D to 2D. You can think original 1D array of size N is resized to a matrix of size \\( (r_2, r_1) \\), \\(r_1\\) is number of cols, while \\(r_2\\) is number of rows

Since \\(k = k_1r_1 + k_0\\), we have
\\[ \omega_N^{kn_1r_2} =\omega_N^{(k_1r_1+k_0)n_1r_2} = \omega_N^{(k_1r_1)n_1r_2} \cdot \omega_N^{k_0n_1r_2}\\]
according to the property of Nth root of unity, \\( \omega_N^{N} = \omega_N^{r_1r_2} =1 \\), \\( \omega_N^{(k_1r_1)n_1r_2}\\) is also 1.
then we have 
\\[ \omega_N^{kn_1r_2} =  \omega_N^{k_0n_1r_2}\\]
substitute it into E.q 2.2, we get 
\\[ \tag{2.3} X(k_1, k_0) = \sum_{n_0} \sum_{n_1}x(n_1,n_0)\omega_N^{kn} = \sum_{n_0} \sum_{n_1}x(n_1,n_0)\omega_N^{k_0n_1r_2}\omega_N^{kn_0}  \\]
Therefore, the inner sum, over \\(n_1\\), depends only on \\(k_0\\) and \\(n_0\\), and can be defined as a new array,
\\[ \tag{2.4} x_1(k_0, n_0) = \sum_{n_1} x(n_1, n_0) \cdot \omega_N^{k_0n_1r_2}\\]
E.q(2.3) can be writtern as
\\[ \tag{2.5} X(k_1, k_0) = \sum_{n_0} x_1(k_0,n_0)\omega_N^{kn_0} =  \sum_{n_0} x_1(k_0,n_0)\omega_N^{(k_1r_1 + k_0)n_0}  \\]

There are N elements in the matrix \\(x_1\\), each requiring \\(r_1\\) operations, giving a total of \\(Nr_1\\) operations. Similarly, it takes \\(Nr_2\\) operations to calculate \\(X\\) from \\(x_1\\). Therefore, the two-step algorithm, given by Eq(2.4) and Eq(2.5) requires a total of
\\[ \tag{2.6} T = N(r_1+r_2) \\]

it is easy to see how successive applications of the above procedure (recursively),  starting with its appliation to Eq(2.4) give an m-step algorihtm requiring 
\\[ \tag{2.7} T = N(r_1+r_2 + ... + r_m) \\]
where 
\\[ N = \prod_{j=1}^{j=m}r_j\\]
if all \\(r_j\\) are equal to \\(r\\), i.e \\(N = r^m \\), which gives \\( m = log_rN \\)
E.q(2.7) becomes
\\[ \tag{2.8} T = N(m \cdot r)  = rNm = rN(log_rN) \\]

The algorithm with \\(r=2\\) is derived by expressing the indices in the form
