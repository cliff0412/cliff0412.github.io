# API
- `__syncthreads()`: A threadâ€™s execution can only proceed past a __syncthreads() after all threads in its block have executed the __syncthreads()
- `__syncwarp()` is an intrinsic function that provides a warp-level synchronization point within a warp. A warp is a group of threads in CUDA that execute instructions in lockstep.
